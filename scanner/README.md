# Scanner / Area Search

**Requires:** [CC:Tweaked] and [Advanced Peripherals]

**Used in:** CC:Tweaked Pocket Computer w/ Advanced Peripherals Geo Scanner attached

**Description:** Scans the area around you for the configured blocks and prints their location if it finds any.

**Configuration:** The `blocks` variable defines what blocks the scanner should look for, just add any block you want or remove those you don't need. You can also just set them to `false` instead of removing them, this is more useful if you want to quickly stop looking for a block for now but continue the search later. Some examples are already provided so you know how to use the variable.
